# OTP_GENERATION_AND_VALIDATION
My code generates OTP and reads input from user,if the OTP entered matches the generated OTP it prints transaction successfull or else 
if the otp entered is wrong it again generates OTP ,the process will be for only 3 times ,if OTP entered is wrong for 3 times then it prints transaction failed.
